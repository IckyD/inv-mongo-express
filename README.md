# Inventory management API

This project is an Inventory Management API built using Express.js and MongoDB. The API allows you to manage items in an inventory system with endpoints for creating, retrieving, searching, and managing stock levels.

## ‚ú® Features
- Add new items to the inventory.
- Retrieve all items or specific items by ID.
- Search items based on name, category, or other criteria.
- Fetch items with low stock levels.
- Lightweight and extendable

## üöÄ Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IckyD/inv-mongo-express.git
cd inv-mongo-express
```

- Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

- Set up your MongoDB database connection:
    - Create a .env file in the project root:
    ```python
    DATABASE="your_mongo_connection_string"
    ```
- Start your server!
```bash
npm run start
```
The server should be up and running at default port of 9000.

## üìñ Usage
